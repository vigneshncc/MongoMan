MongoMan (MongoManager)
========

A GUI for MongoDb

MongoMan provides a graphical front end to your mongoDB installation. You can view, create, remove and inspect databases, documents and their contents through your web browser. I was inspired by how useful genghisapp is when I am developing using mongodb. However, I realized genghis' limitations because I still had to use the command line to do more powerful tasks like executing queries. MongoMan aims to include a full-blown mongodb console right in the browser. It aims to make viewing, editing, saving, querying and almost every administrative function accessible via your browser. Fork me and contribute so we can make this better.
